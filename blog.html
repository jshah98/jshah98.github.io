          <p>October 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>

          <p>Article commented on: <a
          href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/10/05/news/canada-pension-plan-fuels-climate-crisis-our-own-retirement-savings">Canada
          Pension Plan fuels the climate crisis with our own retirement savings</a> (October
          5<sup>th</sup>, 2020)</p>

          <p>Investing in a sustainable future reduces the downside
          impact of climate-risk on investments significantly but it does not mean that
          investing if fossil fuels is unprofitable. Many world-class investment managers
          and banks have <a
          href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">announced</a>
          their support for the energy transition due to its impact on investment
          returns. However, many firms are still invested and <a
          href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/10/05/news/canada-pension-plan-fuels-climate-crisis-our-own-retirement-savings">investing
          in fossil fuels</a>.</p>

          <h3>About climate-risk in finance</h3>

          <p>Governments fund projects in one of two ways; bonds and
          taxes. With a rise in natural disasters, governments' ability to pay <a
          href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">lenders</a>
          will be hindered making the bond market more volatile. Furthermore, an increase
          in natural disasters impacts flood and fire insurance in impacted areas which,
          in turn, will increase the risk of long-term mortgages - a key factor in
          building <a
          href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">investment
          portfolios</a>. From a business point of view, an increase in droughts and
          flooding will impact general productivity causing cost of goods to rise.
          Increased price and reduced productivity will impact inflation and interest
          rates. Therefore, it will be crucial for financial institutions to build models
          that incorporate climate change. </p>

          <h3>How are banks handling climate risk?</h3>

          <p>In recent history, many <a
          href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">investment
          firms</a> have started to consider the energy transition as a major factor in
          making investment decisions. <a
          href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-pledges-to-push-clients-to-align-with-paris-climate-agreement-11602018245">JP
          Morgan</a> announced it will urge clients to align their goals with the Paris
          Agreement. <a
          href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-hldg-climatechange-exclusive/exclusive-hsbc-targets-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-earmarks-1-trillion-green-financing-idUSKBN26U0E8">HSBC</a>
          announced that it will invest up to $1 trillion in green energy. The world's
          biggest fund manager, <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/business/dealbook/larry-fink-blackrock-climate-change.html">BlackRock</a>,
          announced that it would make investment decisions with environmental sustainability
          as a core goal. Many banks are reassessing their investment practices because
          it is in the best interests of their clients from a financial perspective.</p>

          <h3>COVID-19 and recent returns</h3>

          <p>Globally, <a
          href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020/key-findings">investments</a>
          in renewable power projects are expected to fall by around 10% this year, which
          is less than the decline in fossil fuel power projects. Prior to 2020, the share
          of clean energy and efficiency had been relatively stagnant over the last 3
          years. However, the share of clean energy and efficiency in total has<a
          href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020/key-findings">
          increased by 5% in 2020</a>. Recent <a
          href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">history</a>
          indicates the renewables are much more resilient than fossil fuels. </p>

          <p>The relative increase in returns from renewables in directly
          proportional to the change in demand and production cause by recent events. Even
          before the pandemic, fossil fuels were <a
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts">under
          pressure</a> from heightened climate activism, divestment campaigns and cheaper
          alternatives, but the transition has been accelerated. For the first time, it
          is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/archives/May20.pdf">projected</a>
          that the US will produce more electricity from renewables than coal this year. Although
          there may be some increased demand for fossil fuels next year, the general <a
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts">expectation</a>
          is that the increased demand for renewable energy will be permanent. </p>

          <h3>Impact of investing in a sustainable future</h3>

          <p>Perception can play a pivotal role in profitability of
          investments. If more financial leaders invest in a sustainable future, it will
          be perceived that sustainable companies are expected to outperform competitors
          therefore encouraging more investors to invest sustainably. Moreover, if there
          is an increased demand for sustainable securities, organizations will have
          easier access to financing. Easier access to capital will further accelerate
          the energy transition as companies will be able to finance sustainable projects
          much more efficiently. </p>

          <h3>The future of fossil fuels</h3>

          <p>Major <a
          href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">organizations</a>
          including banks, governments and energy companies believe that the energy
          transition will be slow and gradual. According to Suncor's 2020 Climate Risk
          and Resilience <a
          href="https://sustainability-prd-cdn.suncor.com/-/media/project/ros/shared/documents/climate-reports/2020-climate-risk-and-resilience-report-en.pdf?modified=20200716182349&amp;_ga=2.128903564.1040030037.1603082793-2144531589.1603082793">Report</a>,
          Suncor believes that "a substantial amount of oil will be required for decades
          as the world gets on track to meet its climate ambitions. This view is also
          supported by forecasts from organizations such as the International Energy
          Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration". Although returns from
          sustainable investments are promising and many major <a
          href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">financial
          institutions</a> are transitioning away from fossil fuels, "it won't happen in
          a flash. And if banks are ignoring that, they risk getting burned by their
          enthusiastic embrace of renewables and shirking of oil and gas". </p>

          <p>By investing in fossil fuels, CPP is still looking out for
          its clients. There will be a genuine demand for fossil fuels in the future as
          noted by Suncor. So by investing in fossil fuels, while keeping a sustainable
          future a priority, <a
          href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/public-media/headlines/2017/cppibs-approach-climate-change">CPP</a>
          is hedging their risks. They are diversifying their energy portfolios so that
          their clients' financial futures are not completely jeopardized in case the energy
          transition takes longer than expected. Like CPP, <a
          href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">BlackRock</a>
          and many other companies have not sworn off fossil fuel investments but are
          still committed to a sustainable future. </p>

        <summary>Ethics of Avoidable Food Waste: What retailers should do about near-expiry products</summary>
        <div>
          <p>December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2017</p>

          <p>In high-income
          countries, a significant portion of the population depends on food banks. In
          March 2016, <a href="https://www.foodbankscanada.ca/getmedia/6173994f-8a25-40d9-acdf-660a28e40f37/HungerCount_2016_final_singlepage.pdf">863,492
          people</a> received food from a food bank in Canada. <a
          href="https://www.foodbankscanada.ca/getmedia/76c734d8-1e03-4102-83ff-18f5d6b4528c/Audited-Financial-Statements-2017-English_1.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf">Food
          Banks Canada</a> spent $1,219,602 on the acquisition and sharing of food from
          March 2016 to March 2017. Although, in <a
          href="http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/full/10.3138/CPP.38.4.497">Toronto</a>,
          only 23% of those who experience food insecurity use food banks. With more
          resources, food banks would be able to provide for more people in need of food.
          Grocery stores waste a significant amount of edible food. Instead of disposing
          food that is near its expiry date, stores should redirect this food to
          charitable organizations, such as food banks, through which food can be brought
          to those in need. There exist technologies which allows retailers to easily track
          and distribute edible food which they would typically throw away. Yet, there is
          a significant amount of avoidable food waste that is produced by retailers.
          Hence, I believe there exists an ethical gap amongst grocery retailers that
          needs to be addressed. </p>

          <h3>About Avoidable Food Waste</h3>

          <p> Retail
          grocery stores unnecessarily waste food. <a
          href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09596526/v76icomplete/106_tfwhaaofsafw.xml">Avoidable
          food waste</a> is defined as "food thrown away because it is no longer wanted
          or has been allowed to go past its best". Primarily, retail stores dispose of
          avoidable food waste by throwing away food that is close to its expiry date.
          This is because consumers <a
          href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09213449/v125icomplete/273_tdsorfwefid.xml">reject
          substandard products</a>. Since these products are likely to go wasted, it is
          beneficial for retailers to <a
          href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09213449/v125icomplete/273_tdsorfwefid.xml">dispose
          of near-expiry items</a> and restock with newer foods more regularly than
          necessary to <a
          href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/124199183/pageviewPDF/B042777FF26B405FPQ/1?accountid=14771">maximize
          sales</a>. Evidence of unnecessary restocking is seen in the data provided in
          figure 1 for a retail store in Italy. In high-income countries, retail stores <a
          href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09596526/v76icomplete/106_tfwhaaofsafw.xml">oversupply
          by over 46%</a>. Therefore, there is certainly a surplus of food. According to
          CBC, Ali-Zain Mevawala, a former manager of a <a
          href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-walmart-food-waste-1.3814719">Walmart's</a>
          produce and bakery department, says he "threw out a shopping cart full of
          produce every day". If such food waste is redistributed to charitable
          organizations to help feed those in need, the amount of avoidable food waste
          can be reduced significantly.</p>

          <h3>From the Retailers Point of View</h3>

          <p>However, it is important to consider the challenges that the retailer may face. Inventory management is difficult for multiple reasons. Mainly, for food retailers, it is difficult due to continuously <a href="http://www.quatrrobss.com/challenges-grocery-operators.php">changing
          market demands</a>. Retailers <a href="https://portal.utoronto.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-6369048-dt-content-rid-41076711_2/courses/Fall-2017-ESC203H1-F-LEC0101/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">require
          reliable product procurement</a> and must restock frequently. Restocking
          frequently increases the amount of food that remains unpurchased, and hence,
          increases the amount of in-store food that expires. If the retailer wishes to
          keep products from expiring and going to waste, appropriate means to track
          expiry dates of in-store products becomes necessary. In addition, <a
          href="https://portal.utoronto.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-6369048-dt-content-rid-41076711_2/courses/Fall-2017-ESC203H1-F-LEC0101/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">grocery
          stores</a> have low margins and require efficient operations to achieve a
          profit. Hence, additional costs to distribute food can be very difficult to
          manage financially. In summation, inventory management and distribution of
          avoidable food waste are very difficult tasks to undertake in food retail. </p>

          <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>

          <p>Currently, there exist many inventory management software for retail. In food retail, features of such software which would help ease the inventory management process include, a real-time database, and collection of meta-data which tracks expiry date of items. A real-time database ensures that the retailer is always adequately prepared to meet the needs of customers and can always accurately track items in the store. Tracking of meta-data, such as expiry dates, would make it easier for store managers to identify which items need to be disposed of or redistributed. A software which allows users to do that is <a href="https://www.lsretail.com/hybrid-cloud-strategy/">LS Nav</a>. LS Nav is an inventory management system which stores data in a real-time, cloud, database. It allows retailers to store various details about each product such as its expiry date. Additionally, it uses artificial intelligence to forecast market demands. Hence, existing technology allows for food retailers to effectively track and manage inventory - importantly, products which can expire.</p>

          <p>Moreover, there also exist multiple technological solutions which allow efficient management and redistribution of foods from retailers to charitable organizations. Specifically, <a href="https://food.cloud/how-foodcloud-works/">FoodCloud</a> is a solution which requires minimal effort from the retailer and allows food banks to easily acquire the necessary food. If a local retailer has food they cannot sell, they simply upload a description of the food using an in-store scanner or the FoodCloud app for smartphones. A local charity that is registered to use the platform receives a notification letting them know that the food is available for collection and the charity can then collect the food from the retailer. This way, the transportation of food is handled by charity volunteers, the charity receives food that can be distributed to those in need, and the retailer improves their social reputation. Although there exist such solutions to significantly reducing avoidable food waste, retail stores do not use them. </p>

          <h3>Social Responsibility</h3>

          <p>Having considered the risks, it seems that retailers should still be expected to reduce avoidable food waste by distributing it to those in need. <a href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/1095658223/fulltextPDF/DE5AA0971E6B46A3PQ/1?accountid=14771">Corporate social responsibility</a> "is concerned with the commitment of companies to contribute to sustainable development, stakeholder interests and enhancement of societal conditions". The definition of corporate social responsibility suggests that corporations, such as food retailers, must accept <a href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/1534141692/fulltextPDF/DE75BEDD2BE545BAPQ/1?accountid=14771">moral obligations</a> which enhance societal conditions. A way in which food retailers can enhance societal conditions, is by providing food for those in need. Retailers should not be expected to provide free food for charities if it becomes an added expensive. Although, if providing food for charities also reduces the retailer's avoidable food waste, then it is acceptable to presume that the retailer should provide for local charities. In addition, wastage implies a lack of <a href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/124199183/pageviewPDF/B042777FF26B405FPQ/1?accountid=14771">moral appreciation</a> of the value of things. Food is very valuable as it is necessary for humans to survive. Wasting food would undermine the value of food. Hence, from a corporate social responsibility perspective of ethics, it is in the best interest of food retailers to provide for local charities. </p>

          <p> Furthermore, in a utilitarian framework, one arrives at the same conclusion. A <a href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00453609/v118i0003/325_idoaube.xml">utilitarian framework</a> "provides a vision of ethical behavior which holds the common interests of humanity as of utmost importance when we make a moral decision". That is, utilitarian ethics compromises rights, duties and justice for the greater happiness of the majority. In the case of distribution of avoidable food waste, the cost of updating inventory incurred by retailers that use technologies such as FoodCloud and LS Nav, decreases the happiness of a few workers. In return, food is delivered to hundreds of people. The happiness of hundreds is much greater than the decreased happiness of a few workers. Hence from a utilitarian standpoint, the ethically correct plan of action for food retailers would be to aid in the distribution of edible food, which would typically be discarded, to local charities.</p>

          <p>Retailers should consider the ethics and benefits of reduced avoidable food waste and distribute food to charitable organizations. They can distribute food easily and effectively with existing technologies such as FoodCloud and LS Nav. The food would be given to those in need, and thus, improve the retailer's social reputation. From a utilitarian perspective, distribution of avoidable food waste would increase overall happiness. In the United States of America, just the redistribution of unwanted processed food can reduce food waste by <a href="https://portal.utoronto.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-6369048-dt-content-rid-41076711_2/courses/Fall-2017-ESC203H1-F-LEC0101/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">167K tons</a>. The statistic hints at the societal impact that can be made if all avoidable food waste is distributed to those in need.</p>
