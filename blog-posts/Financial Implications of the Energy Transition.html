Pension Plan fuels the climate crisis with our own retirement savings</a> (October
5<sup>th</sup>, 2020)</p>

<p>Investing in a sustainable future reduces the downside
impact of climate-risk on investments significantly but it does not mean that
investing if fossil fuels is unprofitable. Many world-class investment managers
and banks have <a
href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">announced</a>
their support for the energy transition due to its impact on investment
returns. However, many firms are still invested and <a

in fossil fuels</a>.</p>

<h3>About climate-risk in finance</h3>

<p>Governments fund projects in one of two ways; bonds and
taxes. With a rise in natural disasters, governments' ability to pay <a
href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">lenders</a>
will be hindered making the bond market more volatile. Furthermore, an increase
in natural disasters impacts flood and fire insurance in impacted areas which,
in turn, will increase the risk of long-term mortgages - a key factor in
building <a
href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">investment
portfolios</a>. From a business point of view, an increase in droughts and
flooding will impact general productivity causing cost of goods to rise.
Increased price and reduced productivity will impact inflation and interest
rates. Therefore, it will be crucial for financial institutions to build models
that incorporate climate change. </p>

<h3>How are banks handling climate risk?</h3>

<p>In recent history, many <a
href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">investment
firms</a> have started to consider the energy transition as a major factor in
making investment decisions. <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-pledges-to-push-clients-to-align-with-paris-climate-agreement-11602018245">JP
Morgan</a> announced it will urge clients to align their goals with the Paris
Agreement. <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-hldg-climatechange-exclusive/exclusive-hsbc-targets-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-earmarks-1-trillion-green-financing-idUSKBN26U0E8">HSBC</a>
announced that it will invest up to $1 trillion in green energy. The world's
biggest fund manager, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/business/dealbook/larry-fink-blackrock-climate-change.html">BlackRock</a>,
announced that it would make investment decisions with environmental sustainability
as a core goal. Many banks are reassessing their investment practices because
it is in the best interests of their clients from a financial perspective.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 and recent returns</h3>

<p>Globally, <a
href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020/key-findings">investments</a>
in renewable power projects are expected to fall by around 10% this year, which
is less than the decline in fossil fuel power projects. Prior to 2020, the share
of clean energy and efficiency had been relatively stagnant over the last 3
years. However, the share of clean energy and efficiency in total has<a
href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020/key-findings">
increased by 5% in 2020</a>. Recent <a
href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">history</a>
indicates the renewables are much more resilient than fossil fuels. </p>

<p>The relative increase in returns from renewables in directly
proportional to the change in demand and production cause by recent events. Even
before the pandemic, fossil fuels were <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts">under
pressure</a> from heightened climate activism, divestment campaigns and cheaper
alternatives, but the transition has been accelerated. For the first time, it
is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/archives/May20.pdf">projected</a>
that the US will produce more electricity from renewables than coal this year. Although
there may be some increased demand for fossil fuels next year, the general <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts">expectation</a>
is that the increased demand for renewable energy will be permanent. </p>

<h3>Impact of investing in a sustainable future</h3>

<p>Perception can play a pivotal role in profitability of
investments. If more financial leaders invest in a sustainable future, it will
be perceived that sustainable companies are expected to outperform competitors
therefore encouraging more investors to invest sustainably. Moreover, if there
is an increased demand for sustainable securities, organizations will have
easier access to financing. Easier access to capital will further accelerate
the energy transition as companies will be able to finance sustainable projects
much more efficiently. </p>

<h3>The future of fossil fuels</h3>

<p>Major <a
href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">organizations</a>
including banks, governments and energy companies believe that the energy
transition will be slow and gradual. According to Suncor's 2020 Climate Risk
and Resilience <a
href="https://sustainability-prd-cdn.suncor.com/-/media/project/ros/shared/documents/climate-reports/2020-climate-risk-and-resilience-report-en.pdf?modified=20200716182349&amp;_ga=2.128903564.1040030037.1603082793-2144531589.1603082793">Report</a>,
Suncor believes that "a substantial amount of oil will be required for decades
as the world gets on track to meet its climate ambitions. This view is also
supported by forecasts from organizations such as the International Energy
Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration". Although returns from
sustainable investments are promising and many major <a
href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Big-Banks-Could-Lose-Billions-In-The-Global-Energy-Transition.html">financial
institutions</a> are transitioning away from fossil fuels, "it won't happen in
a flash. And if banks are ignoring that, they risk getting burned by their
enthusiastic embrace of renewables and shirking of oil and gas". </p>

<p>By investing in fossil fuels, CPP is still looking out for
its clients. There will be a genuine demand for fossil fuels in the future as
noted by Suncor. So by investing in fossil fuels, while keeping a sustainable
future a priority, <a
href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/public-media/headlines/2017/cppibs-approach-climate-change">CPP</a>
is hedging their risks. They are diversifying their energy portfolios so that
their clients' financial futures are not completely jeopardized in case the energy
transition takes longer than expected. Like CPP, <a
href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">BlackRock</a>
and many other companies have not sworn off fossil fuel investments but are
still committed to a sustainable future. </p>
