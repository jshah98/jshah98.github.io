
<h2> Ethics
of Avoidable Food Waste: What retailers should do about near-expiry products </h2>

<p>December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2017</p>

<p>In high-income
countries, a significant portion of the population depends on food banks. In
March 2016, <a href="https://www.foodbankscanada.ca/getmedia/6173994f-8a25-40d9-acdf-660a28e40f37/HungerCount_2016_final_singlepage.pdf">863,492
people</a> received food from a food bank in Canada. <a
href="https://www.foodbankscanada.ca/getmedia/76c734d8-1e03-4102-83ff-18f5d6b4528c/Audited-Financial-Statements-2017-English_1.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf">Food
Banks Canada</a> spent $1,219,602 on the acquisition and sharing of food from
March 2016 to March 2017. Although, in <a
href="http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/full/10.3138/CPP.38.4.497">Toronto</a>,
only 23% of those who experience food insecurity use food banks. With more
resources, food banks would be able to provide for more people in need of food.
Grocery stores waste a significant amount of edible food. Instead of disposing
food that is near its expiry date, stores should redirect this food to
charitable organizations, such as food banks, through which food can be brought
to those in need. There exist technologies which allows retailers to easily track
and distribute edible food which they would typically throw away. Yet, there is
a significant amount of avoidable food waste that is produced by retailers.
Hence, I believe there exists an ethical gap amongst grocery retailers that
needs to be addressed. </p>

<p> Retail
grocery stores unnecessarily waste food. <a
href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09596526/v76icomplete/106_tfwhaaofsafw.xml">Avoidable
food waste</a> is defined as "food thrown away because it is no longer wanted
or has been allowed to go past its best". Primarily, retail stores dispose of
avoidable food waste by throwing away food that is close to its expiry date.
This is because consumers <a
href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09213449/v125icomplete/273_tdsorfwefid.xml">reject
substandard products</a>. Since these products are likely to go wasted, it is
beneficial for retailers to <a
href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09213449/v125icomplete/273_tdsorfwefid.xml">dispose
of near-expiry items</a> and restock with newer foods more regularly than
necessary to <a
href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/124199183/pageviewPDF/B042777FF26B405FPQ/1?accountid=14771">maximize
sales</a>. Evidence of unnecessary restocking is seen in the data provided in
figure 1 for a retail store in Italy. In high-income countries, retail stores <a
href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09596526/v76icomplete/106_tfwhaaofsafw.xml">oversupply
by over 46%</a>. Therefore, there is certainly a surplus of food. According to
CBC, Ali-Zain Mevawala, a former manager of a <a
href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-walmart-food-waste-1.3814719">Walmart's</a>
produce and bakery department, says he "threw out a shopping cart full of
produce every day". If such food waste is redistributed to charitable
organizations to help feed those in need, the amount of avoidable food waste
can be reduced significantly.</p>

<p>However, it is
important to consider the challenges that the retailer may face. Inventory
management is difficult for multiple reasons. Mainly, for food retailers, it is
difficult due to continuously <a
href="http://www.quatrrobss.com/challenges-grocery-operators.php">changing
market demands</a>. Retailers <a
href="https://portal.utoronto.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-6369048-dt-content-rid-41076711_2/courses/Fall-2017-ESC203H1-F-LEC0101/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">require
reliable product procurement</a> and must restock frequently. Restocking
frequently increases the amount of food that remains unpurchased, and hence,
increases the amount of in-store food that expires. If the retailer wishes to
keep products from expiring and going to waste, appropriate means to track
expiry dates of in-store products becomes necessary. In addition, <a
href="https://portal.utoronto.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-6369048-dt-content-rid-41076711_2/courses/Fall-2017-ESC203H1-F-LEC0101/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">grocery
stores</a> have low margins and require efficient operations to achieve a
profit. Hence, additional costs to distribute food can be very difficult to
manage financially. In summation, inventory management and distribution of
avoidable food waste are very difficult tasks to undertake in food retail. </p>

<p>Currently,
there exist many inventory management software for retail. In food retail,
features of such software which would help ease the inventory management
process include, a real-time database, and collection of meta-data which tracks
expiry date of items. A real-time database ensures that the retailer is always adequately
prepared to meet the needs of customers and can always accurately track items
in the store. Tracking of meta-data, such as expiry dates, would make it easier
for store managers to identify which items need to be disposed of or
redistributed. A software which allows users to do that is LS Nav. LS Nav is an
inventory management system which stores data in a real-time, cloud, database.
It allows retailers to store various details about each product such as its
expiry date. Additionally, it uses <a
href="https://www.lsretail.com/hybrid-cloud-strategy/">artificial intelligence</a>
to forecast market demands. Hence, existing technology allows for food
retailers to effectively track and manage inventory - importantly, products
which can expire.</p>

<p>Moreover,
there also exist multiple technological solutions which allow efficient
management and redistribution of foods from retailers to charitable organizations.
Specifically, <a href="https://food.cloud/how-foodcloud-works/">FoodCloud</a>
is a solution which requires minimal effort from the retailer and allows food
banks to easily acquire the necessary food. If a local retailer has food they
cannot sell, they simply upload a description of the food using an in-store
scanner or the FoodCloud app for smartphones. A local charity that is
registered to use the platform receives a notification letting them know that
the food is available for collection and the charity can then collect the food
from the retailer. This way, the transportation of food is handled by charity
volunteers, the charity receives food that can be distributed to those in need,
and the retailer improves their social reputation. Although there exist such
solutions to significantly reducing avoidable food waste, retail stores do not
use them. </p>

<p>Having
considered the risks, it seems that retailers should still be expected to
reduce avoidable food waste by distributing it to those in need. <a
href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/1095658223/fulltextPDF/DE5AA0971E6B46A3PQ/1?accountid=14771">Corporate
social responsibility</a> "is concerned with the commitment of companies to
contribute to sustainable development, stakeholder interests and enhancement of
societal conditions". The definition of corporate social responsibility
suggests that corporations, such as food retailers, must accept <a
href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/1534141692/fulltextPDF/DE75BEDD2BE545BAPQ/1?accountid=14771">moral
obligations</a> which enhance societal conditions. A way in which food
retailers can enhance societal conditions, is by providing food for those in
need. Retailers should not be expected to provide free food for charities if it
becomes an added expensive. Although, if providing food for charities also
reduces the retailer's avoidable food waste, then it is acceptable to presume
that the retailer should provide for local charities. In addition, wastage
implies a lack of <a
href="https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/124199183/pageviewPDF/B042777FF26B405FPQ/1?accountid=14771">moral
appreciation</a> of the value of things. Food is very valuable as it is
necessary for humans to survive. Wasting food would undermine the value of
food. Hence, from a corporate social responsibility perspective of ethics, it
is in the best interest of food retailers to provide for local charities. </p>

<p> Furthermore,
in a utilitarian framework, one arrives at the same conclusion. A <a
href="https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00453609/v118i0003/325_idoaube.xml">utilitarian
framework</a> "provides a vision of ethical behavior which holds the common
interests of humanity as of utmost importance when we make a moral decision". That
is, utilitarian ethics compromises rights, duties and justice for the greater
happiness of the majority. In the case of distribution of avoidable food waste,
the cost of updating inventory incurred by retailers that use technologies such
as FoodCloud and LS Nav, decreases the happiness of a few workers. In return,
food is delivered to hundreds of people. The happiness of hundreds is much
greater than the decreased happiness of a few workers. Hence from a utilitarian
standpoint, the ethically correct plan of action for food retailers would be to
aid in the distribution of edible food, which would typically be discarded, to local charities.</p>

<p>Retailers
should consider the ethics and benefits of reduced avoidable food waste and
distribute food to charitable organizations. They can distribute food easily
and effectively with existing technologies such as FoodCloud and LS Nav. The
food would be given to those in need, and thus, improve the retailer's social
reputation. From a utilitarian perspective, distribution of avoidable food
waste would increase overall happiness. In the United States of America, just
the redistribution of unwanted processed food can reduce food waste by <a
href="https://portal.utoronto.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-6369048-dt-content-rid-41076711_2/courses/Fall-2017-ESC203H1-F-LEC0101/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">167K
tons</a>. The statistic hints at the societal impact that can be made if all
avoidable food waste is distributed to those in need.</p>
