      <profile-card title="Robo-Advisor" company="" date="September 2020 - December 2020" description="Created an investment advisor using Python and Firebase – recommended portfolios back-tested over twelve 5-year periods yielded annual returns of at least 13% from 2005-2020. The flow of the program is as follows: the user signs-up/logs-in and is directed to their investment preferences page. Once the investment preferences are set, they are prompted to create a portfolio. To create a portfolio, various macro-economic factors are forecasted, and securities are eliminated based on investor preferences, and then, based on the user’s risk tolerance, various portfolio optimization techniques are back-tested over 15 five year periods. Then, the most optimal portfolio is recommended for the user." code= "| <a href='https://utoronto-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/maddie_shiell_mail_utoronto_ca/EVj7ulkHYfRMie9q2tdsWIgBDfVz9w3tPXRgmv45OwadiA?e=jXgarE'>View the presentation</a> |"></profile-card>

      <profile-card title="Equity Portfolios - Model Comparisons II" company="" date="April 2019" description="The purpose of this project was to study Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization and Robust CVaR with scenario-based optimization using Monte-Carlo simulations. Two simulations were be used: Gaussian Monte-Carlo and Non-normal Monte-Carlo with higher moments. The simulations were used to create factor scenarios for each of the Fama-French factor returns. The Fama-French model was then used to create 5000 asset scenarios which were used to create portfolios which minimize losses using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) with a confidence level of 95%. A Robust CVaR portfolio was also created with a robustness level of 90%. It was observed that the portfolios had very similar volatility expectations and realizations, but those created using the Non-normal Monte-Carlo simulations had higher returns (11.6% annually) and better Sharpe ratios. Accuracy of results can be improved with the inclusion of more assets, observation of the assets for a longer time period, more simulations and inclusion of investor perspectives in the formulation of the problem." code= "| <a href='https://github.com/jshah98/MIE377P2'>Github</a> | <a href='docs/ReportProject2.pdf'>Final Report</a> |"></profile-card>

In total, six portfolios were compared. The PCA factor models performed the best, followed by the French-Fama factor models with the highest annual returns being 12.7%. Additionally, investment strategies using MVO with cardinality constraints have a slightly higher portfolio return than their MVO counterparts that do not have cardinality constraints." code= "| <a href='https://github.com/jshah98/MIE377-Project-1'>Github</a> | <a href='docs/MIE377Project1.pdf'>Final Report</a> |"></profile-card>
